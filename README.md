### Understanding Ketosis and How It Works
Ketosis is a metabolic state where the body shifts from using glucose as its primary energy source to burning fat. This transition occurs when carbohydrate intake is drastically reduced, leading the liver to produce ketones from stored fat. Ketones serve as an alternative energy source, fueling the brain and muscles efficiently.

### Benefits of the Keto Diet
- **Weight Loss**: Keto helps burn fat quickly due to increased fat oxidation.
- **Improved Mental Clarity**: Ketones provide a more stable energy source for the brain.
- **Better Blood Sugar Control**: Helps manage insulin levels and may benefit diabetics.
- **Increased Energy Levels**: Reduces energy crashes associated with carb-heavy diets.
- **Appetite Suppression**: High-fat foods promote satiety and reduce cravings.

### Keto Diet Macros: How to Calculate
A standard keto diet typically consists of:
- **70-80% Fat**
- **10-20% Protein**
- **5-10% Carbohydrates**

Use a keto macro calculator to determine your ideal macronutrient intake based on weight, age, activity level, and goals.
